## Calibration info calculation ##

measured_none: Measured value for sensor suspended in open air at 20°C, 5v.
measured_full: Measured value when sensing element is fully submerged
               in salt water at 20°C, 5v.
max_value: Target value for maximum reading.
Vih: Minimum voltage for a I/O line to read as 'HIGH'. This value is
     approx 0.7 volts.
Vint: internal voltage refence
Vod:	(Vcc-Voh), voltage drop for an I/O pin driven high
env_factor:	Compensation for voltage and temperature.

	calib_offset = measured_none
	calib_range = (measured_full-measured_none)

	calib_value = (value-calib_offset*env_factor)*env_factor*max_value/calib_range

Other variables to consider: temperature and voltage.

Since the read threshold voltage for I/O pins is Vcc/2, we can disregard
voltage because it is already self-compensating.

Temperature will affect the moisture readings in complicated ways, for
two reasons:

	* Ice doesn't conduct electricity, so readings should start to
	  quickly decrease below ~4°C.
	* The capacity of the holding capacitor will increase at colder
	  temps, and decrease at higher temps. This behavior is the inverse
	  of the ice issue above.

TODO: Figure out the temperature compensation.
