## Calibration info calculation ##

measured_none: Measured value for sensor suspended in open air at 20°C, 5v.
measured_full: Measured value when sensing element is fully submerged
               in salt water at 20°C, 5v.
max_value: Target value for maximum reading.
Vint: internal voltage refence
Vod:	(Vcc-Voh), voltage drop for an I/O pin driven high
env_factor:	Compensation for voltage and temperature.

	calib_offset = measured_none
	calib_range = (measured_full-measured_none)

	calib_value = (value-calib_offset*env_factor)*env_factor*max_value/calib_range

Other variables to consider: temperature and voltage.

Since the read threshold voltage for I/O pins is Vcc/2, we can disregard
voltage because it is already self-compensating.

Temperature will affect the moisture readings in complicated ways, for
two reasons:

	* Ice doesn't conduct electricity, so readings should start to
	  quickly decrease below ~4°C.
	* The capacity of the holding capacitor will change as the temperature
	  changes.

TODO: Figure out the temperature compensation.

## Construction notes ##

One of the most important parts of building these sensors is making sure that
the sensing electrodes are FULLY insulated from the soil/moisture/liquid/etc.
This is the number one reason for bad readings. Keep in mind that even materials
which you would normally think of as water-impermiable actually do absorb some
measureable amount of water, such as Plasti-Dip. Yep, that's right, as cool
as plasti-dip is, if you use it your readings will not be as accurate as they
could be.

The ideal insulator for the electrodes would be a thin layer of glass. This
isn't really feasible when using PCBs, so we need something else.

I'm currently experimenting with different insulators now, including epoxy,
enamel, variations on plast-dip(I got to try...), etc. I'll be documenting
which ones work the best here in the future. So far it looks like heavy-duty
industrial enamel paint or epoxy is the way to go.

From what I've been able to determine so far, you want the finish of your
insulator to be *shiny*. If your insulator has a matte look to it, that means
that water will tend to adhere longer to it than it otherwise would. Also avoid
anything rubbery, as that can absorb water/oil/etc., which will (you guessed it)
throw off your readings.

I've been using [Rustoleum High-Performance Enamel Spray]
(http://www.rustoleum.com/CBGProduct.asp?pid=95) (RHPES), and while initial indications
seemed positive, I am noticing my moisture readings increase significantly after
prolonged exposure to water. While I don't have a conclusive explanation for
why this might be happening, my current hypothesis is that the enamel is
actually absorbing some water which is either changing its electrical
conductivity and/or changing its dielectric constant. I will do more testing
do see if these properties improve with extended drying times.

I partially submerged (about half-way) a sensor that had a coating of RHPES in
a glass of water. The RHPES had been applied 24-48 hours prior. I removed the
sensor after around 12-18 hours and I could visually see changes in the paint
at the water line---confirming that water had indeed been absorbed into the
enamel. Additionally the zero capacitance offset increased by one level, further
indicating absorbtion of water into the coating. This offset disappeared after
around 20 minutes.

It is entirely possible that this is less pronounced after extended
drying periods, so more testing is needed. But it doesn't look good at this
point for RHPES.

While the sensor can run at 3.3 volts, the moisture precision will be less than
what is achievable at 5 volts. For best performance, run at 5 volts.

One mistake I made was to add lots of vias thruought the electrodes---with the
goal being to make sure both sides acted like the same electrode. This was a
bad idea because I would need to then fill the vias manually after the fact
to make sure that they don't let water seep in and start conducting. This has
turned out to be a major pain. The design has already been updated to not
have so many vias, but that doesn't fix the 40+ boards I already have.
