Protocol

This sensor uses the 1-wire slave protocol. It supports the following ROM funcitons:

	0x33 READROM
	0x55 MATCHROM
	0xCC SKIPROM
	0xF0 SEARCH
	0xEC ALARMSEARCH

It supports the following funciton commands:

DS18B20 Compatibility: (Temperature only)
	0x44 CONVERT_T
	0xBE RD_SCRATCH

Name access:	(For storing the name of the sensor as a UTF-8 string)
	0xF1 RD_NAME
	0xF2 WR_NAME

Sensor access: (DS2450 compatible)
	0x3C CONVERT
	0xAA RD_MEM
	0x55 WR_MEM
	0x48 COMMIT_MEM
	0xB8 RECALL_MEM


Channel A is normalized moisture level. Alarms are supported on this channel.
Channel B is raw capacitive reading. Alarms are *NOT* supported on this channel.
Channel C is raw temperature reading. Alarms are *NOT* supported on this channel.
Channel D is raw voltage reading. Alarms are *NOT* supported on this channel.

Unlike a real DS2450, this devie will be busy while converting. Send read
slots to determine when it is finished---will read '1' when done.
