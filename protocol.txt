# Soil Moisture Sensor Protocol Documentation #

NOTE: THIS IS ALL CURRENTLY IN FLUX. THIS DOCUMENTATION MAY NOT REFLECT THE
ACTUAL PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTED IN THE SOURCE CODE. THIS WILL BE FIXED BEFORE THE
OFFICIAL RELEASE.

This sensor uses the 1-wire slave protocol. This protocol is widely documented.
See the 1-Wire/iButton Standard (referenced at the end of this document) for
more information.

## Patent Notice ##

The 1-wire protocol is patented: USPAT#6,108,751

You will need to obtain a license for the 1-wire protocol if you plan to
construct any significant number of these devices, otherwise MAXIM will come
knocking at your door with angry lawyers.

## ROM Commands ##

This device supports the following ROM funcitons:

 * `0x33` READROM
 * `0x55` MATCHROM
 * `0xCC` SKIPROM
 * `0xF0` SEARCH
 * `0xEC` ALARMSEARCH

Overdrive commands are not (yet?) supported.

## Function Commands ##

This device supports the following funciton commands:

 * `0xAA` READMEM
 * `0x55` WRITEMEM
 * `0x48` COMMITMEM
 * `0xB8` RECALLMEM
 * `0x3C` CONVERT
 * `0x44` CONVERT_T
 * `0xBE` RD_SCRATCH (Only when built with DS18B20 compatibility mode)

### READMEM and WRITEMEM ###

READMEM and WRITEMEM work similar to how they work on other 1-wire or
iButton devices: each takes a two-byte start address and then either
reads out or reads in bytes to be read or written respectively. At each
eight-byte page boundary, a 16-bit CRC is returned from the device.

See the datasheet for the DS2450 for more information on how to use READMEM
and WRITEMEM. See the "Memory Map" section below for an explanation of the
data structures.

### COMMITMEM and RECALLMEM ###

The values contained in the later two pages of memory (0x08-0x17) are loaded
from EEPROM when the device is first powered up. If you modify values at these
locations using the WRITEMEM command, you will lose your changes the next time
the device power-cycles unless you issue a COMMITMEM command. The COMMITMEM
command will save the contents of the later two pages to EEPROM so that the
values will persist across power cycles.

The RECALLMEM command will cause the device to revert any changes made to the
last two pages by updating them with the current values stored in EEPROM,
similar to what happens when the device is first powered up.

### CONVERT and CONVERT_T ###

The CONVERT and CONVERT_T commands are used to initiate the sensor's sampling
process. Upon completion, the value of the sensor's readings can be retrieved
from the first page (0x00-0x07) of memory using the READMEMORY command.

There is only one difference between the two commands: CONVERT_T begins the
conversion process immediately after the last bit of the command is sent,
whereas the CONVERT command expects two bytes (the values of which are ignored)
before the conversion process begins.

The device will be busy while the conversion is taking place---issuing a
1-wire reset on the bus will interrupt the conversion process. The status
of the conversion may be polled by sending read time slots. While the device
is busy converting, a read time slot will return '0'. When it is finished,
it will return '1'.

The CONVERT command is compatible with DS2450-type parts, and the CONVERT_T is
compatible with DS18B20-type parts.

### RD_SCRATCH ###

This command allows the device to behave like a DS18B20 temperature sensor.
It is only available on hardware that has built-in temperature sensors and when
the firmware has been built with DS18B20 emulation enabled.

The only fields with valid values are the temperature field and the CRC field.
All other bytes should be ignored. The WR_SCRATCH command is not supported.

See the DS18B20 datasheet for more information.

## Memory Map ##

Below is the memory map of the device, accessable via the READMEM and WRITEMEM
commands.

### Page 0 - Sensor Values ###

 * `0x00` MOISTURE_L
 * `0x01` MOISTURE_H
 * `0x02` RAW_L
 * `0x03` RAW_H
 * `0x04` TEMPERATURE_L
 * `0x05` TEMPERATURE_H
 * `0x06` VOLTAGE_L
 * `0x07` VOLTAGE_H

MOISTURE_L and MOISTURE_H are the respective low and high bytes of the moisture
value. This value is calculated directly from the value of the RAW field and
the calibration data from page 2. The value ranges from 0x0000 (Most dry) to
0xFFFF (Most wet).

RAW_L and RAW_H are the respective low and high bytes of the raw capacitance
reading of the soil.

TEMPERATURE_L and TEMPERATURE_H are the respective low and high bytes of the
measured temperature. The value of this field is encoded in a format compatible
with the DS18B20 temperature reading. See the DS18B20 datasheet for more
details.

VOLTAGE_L and VOLTAGE_H are the respective low and high bytes of the
measured voltage. This value may be converted to the actual voltage using the
following formula:

    VCC = 1024.0*1.1/(VOLTAGE_L+(VOLTAGE_H<<8))
